# A list of simple console apps written in java for beginners



When I started learning Java, I didn't find any ideas for console apps which I can implement them with java,  as a practice for me in order to apply the OOP concepts and to focus on the logic and not gotten distracted with anything else
And all I found, were ideas for projects made with GUI , so I decide to make this list of console apps for anyone who started learning Java.
